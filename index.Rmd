### Open Source?

1.  The software is free to use (no license cost). The Odoo business
    model is based on quality services: hosting, migrations, bug fixing,
    customizations, etc.
2.  The Odoo source code is publicly shared, so anyone who wants to
    modify it or add his own custom-made apps can do so. Odoo SA
    certifies more than 200 official business applications that can be
    used in all areas. Our community is also implicated in the product
    life and has been developing 3000 extra applications tailored to
    specific needs. See all our apps at <http://www.odoo.com/apps.>

Online vs On-premise
:::

### Online vs On-premise

Odoo can be used online or deployed on your own server. For your first
steps with Odoo, we recommend you to use the Online version first:

-   Start in a few clicks;
-   Benefit from all the certified Odoo applications;
-   Fully configured: email integration, pads, dns, etc.;
-   Backups, monitoring, redundancy, instance management.

Getting Started with Odoo
:::

## Getting Started with Odoo

### Create an Odoo Online Instance

Go to <http://www.odoo.com> and clickCRM. Then, enter the name of your
instance (with "-" if needed but without spaces or "\_") and click Start
Now. Next, enter the required data to create your Odoo account
(necessary to create the admin user) and click Start Using.

You now have your own instance which will be available at the following
web address: yourname.odoo.com. CRM has already been installed.

Let's get some settings straight first!

::: index
Set up your Company
:::

### Set up your Company

Click the Odoo logo at the top left corner in order to set your
company's information & logo.

::: index
Create a New User
:::

### Create a New User

Go to Settings → Users → Users and create a new user for your colleague.
Do not use the same email address. Each user should have his own email
address to log on.

::: note
::: title
Note
:::

-   **Email:** the email address you set, is the one the user has to
    enter when he logs on to Odoo. As soon as you save the page, Odoo
    sends a message to that email address so this new user can sign up
    to Odoo.com and get access to your instance. The new user can choose
    his own password.
-   **Access Rights:** The user form allows you to assign specific
    access rights for each installed application. When you install a new
    app, have a look at the access rights you can grant to users.
-   **Portal:** dedicated to external users (i.e. customers to retrieve
    their orders, invoices in the customer portal).
-   **Technical Features:** reserved for the instance admin/configurator
    (access to technical menu).
-   **Messaging Alias:** on the Preferences tab, you find the internal
    email address used by Odoo Messaging. If you send an email to that
    address from an external mailbox, you will receive the message in
    your Odoo Inbox. Read more about messages in the chapter concerned.
-   **Receive Messages by Email:** For all the messages received in your
    Odoo Inbox, a notification can be sent to your external email
    address (the one used to log on to your Odoo.com account). Here you
    can change your notification rule.
:::

### Install a Second System Language

Each user can use Odoo in his own language. Go to Settings →
Translations → Load a Translation and install a second language. You can
set a default language for each user in the User form. You can also
change it in your Preferences (top right side of the screen).

## Populate your Address Book

### Enter your First Contact

Create your first contact in Form view.

::: note
::: title
Note
:::

-   **Blue Field:** mandatory field
-   **Lookup fields:** From Form view, Odoo allows you to open a new
    list/form in order to select or create another record. There are 3
    different types: many-to-one (e.g. countries), one-to-many (e.g.
    contact persons for a company), many-to-many (e.g. contact tags).
-   **Tooltips:** hovering the mouse over the field name will display a
    short help text.
-   **Tab key:** If the value (content) of a field can be selected from
    a list of records (e.g. countries), you can quickly select the one
    required by entering part of its name in the field and hit the Tab
    key.
-   **Create and Edit:** If the value of a field can be selected from a
    list of records, you can quickly create a new one by clicking the
    drop-down list arrow and selecting Create and Edit. A new form view
    will open.
-   **Search More:** If the value of a field can be selected from a list
    of records and if the desired record does not appear directly in the
    drop-down list, you can open the complete list of records by
    clicking 'Search More'.
-   **Back & Forward buttons:** In form view, use the back/forward
    arrows to display the form view of the previous/next record.
-   **More button:** allows to open related records, delete and
    duplicate the current record.
-   **Print button:** shows reports associated with the selected record
    (when available).
:::

### Import your Address Book

If you already have a list of contacts, you would waste time if you
start entering each item one by one. Let's import your contact list!

-   From the List view, click Import in order to import your address
    book saved in CSV (Comma Separated Values, can be generated from
    Excel, Libre Office Calc, Google Spreadsheet, \...). Have a look at
    the CSV file shared in your training material repository. You have
    to follow the same structure. It will help you to make your first
    import.
-   Once imported, sort the contacts by inverse alphabetical order.

::: note
::: title
Note
:::

In your spread sheet file, each column has to be dedicated to a specific
Odoo field. The first row contains these dedicated fields.
:::

::: tip
::: title
Tip
:::

-   Odoo comes with different kinds of views: List view will show an
    overview of similar records at a time. To get more specific
    information about a record, you can switch to Form view.
-   If you want to go further with the import, have a look at the
    Frequently Asked Questions in the Import interface.
-   For complex imports, send your request to <online@odoo.com>! We
    import any kind of data for you:
    <https://www.odoo.com/page/pricing>.

### Discover the Power of Filters

::: note
::: title
Note
:::

-   **Search options:** At the top right of all views (except for the
    Formview) you find a search box with several tools (click the
    drop-down menu) to configure the search or group the records. The
    options displayed depend on the business application.
-   **Search box:** displays all applied filters and allows to quickly
    find records by typing and selecting some criteria. Matching results
    will be displayed.
-   **Filters:** allow you to apply conditions to fields. Some filters
    exist by default, but you can add new ones (use Save current
    filter).
-   **Group by:** groups records in the list according to your needs
    (multiple levels).
-   Save current filter / Advanced Search: allow to save the current
    filter (becomes available in Favorites), to edit an advanced search
    based on conditions, and to add the current filter to a dashboard
    (see Reporting).
:::

In the imported address book:

-   How many physical contacts do you have?
-   Display the contacts ('persons' in the filter) and group them by
    country, then by company.
-   Save the current filter in order to retrieve it next time.
-   Make an advanced search to get all customers located in New York
    itself.

## Improve your Internal & External Communication

### Add Followers and Engage Discussions with them

A chatter is available below the form view of various business items.
This feature allows you to considerably improve the internal and
external communication: any user or external people can be added as
followers. Status updates are included as automatic messages. Followers
receive email notifications in case of a new message in their inbox.

-   Open the form of one of your contacts.
-   Add your colleague as a follower and send him a message from the
    chatter (e.g. "I would like to present him to you; he is managing a
    similar company and could help you in developing the market.").
-   If you log on as this colleague, you will find the message in your
    external mailbox. Click the Access your messages and documents in
    Odoo link to open the contact form and display the context and the
    message history.

::: tip
::: title
Tip
:::

This chatter can be used in all Odoo business documents. You can add any
contact of your database as a follower (user, customer, supplier, etc.).
External people (without user account) will receive your messages in
their external mailbox too.
:::

Each contact can set up his own notification preferences for each
business document he is following.

### Easily Create a ToDo List from your Inbox

Some messages may require some actions on your side.

-   Click the Star to gather those actions in your ToDo list.
-   Once you have read all your messages in the morning, look at your
    Todo menu item. You get a list of all the tasks you have to perform.
-   Reply to people or click "V" to mark the message as done.

### Start a Discussion Group

Users can exchange messages, attach documents and receive discussion
updates concerning the groups they joined.

In theMy Groupssection, you can set up and join discussion groups. Each
discussion group has its own privacy settings. You can create internal
or public groups. Everytime someone posts a message to the group (or
replies to a message), all the followers get a notification in their
Inbox.

### Chat with your colleagues

-   Install Instant Messaging and chat with your connected colleagues
    (internal database users).
-   Click the icon at the top of the screen to display the available
    contacts.

## Manage your Time Efficiently!

### Manage your Agenda

Get your meetings, yours holidays, \... Get your calendar anywhere and
never forget an event.

-   Install the Calendar app.
-   Create a meeting and share it with some attendees in your address
    book. They will receive a notification by email.

### Create Collaborative Notes and Get Things Done!

Organize yourself with efficient to-do lists and notes. From personal
tasks to collaborative meeting minutes, you can increase the
productivity of your employees by giving them the right tools to
prioritize their work, share their ideas and collaborate on documents.

-   Install Odoo Notes.
-   Customize your ToDo stages: add a stage and drag it to the right
    place.
-   Create a note and share it with your colleague. Add a tag to
    categorize it and put the note in a different stage.
-   Each follower is able to open the note from the Followers
    notification email.

## Case introduction: the NotSoTinyCompany

### Introduction

Odoo ERP is a powerful application, having lots of different features in
hundreds of functional areas. The best way to learn Odoo ERP is to
practice a real situation. This chapter presents a learning exercise,
based on a simple example, to gradually make you discover the basic
functions of Odoo ERP.

The goal of this tutorial/exercise is a uniﬁed presentation of the main
features of the software, without considering the various details and
parameters.

### History and market position

NotSoTiny is a company located in Belgium, with a dedicated factory
manufacturing wooden bookshelves. The company was created in 1978 by
Nick Hawson and Luke Stason.

-   Nick Hawson, the current managing director, has a technical
    background, and is behind the most famous innovations of the
    company.
-   Luke Stason, the vice-president, has a more commercial and ﬁnancial
    background.

NotSoTiny employs 80 persons, and occupies a leading position in the
industry. A strategic market positioning has permitted a clear
distinction from NotSoTiny's competition:

-   A relatively small range of products, but with a high quality,
    focused mainly on two models of cabinets.
-   An engineering and design ofﬁce that proposes analysis projects
    tailored for individual and enterprise customers.

### Company organisation

The various departments of NotSoTiny company are:

-   A Commercial department composed of 1 sales manager and 3 salesmen.
    It works with 2 types of cus-tomers: direct consumers and retailers.

-   A Research and Development (R&D) department with 1 project manager
    and 3 prototype developers. They have two main responsibilities:

    > -- develop products on the request of large customers, -- develop
    > new products.

-   A Production department responsible for manufacturing cupboards as
    well as efﬁcient maintenance of Bills of Material (BoM) and
    manufacturing routes.

-   An IT department which will be responsible for the administration of
    Odoo ERP once it will have been integrated.

-   An Accounting and Financial department which is in charge of the
    Financial Management. It must also control the budgets of R&D
    projects and the invoicing processes of the various activities of
    the company.

### NotSoTiny Products

The main product of the company is a Picaso bookshelf declined in two
different models:

-   a bookshelf having a width of 1 meter,
-   a bookshelf having a width of 2 meters. A "Picaso" bookshelf is
    composed of
-   3 external support panels (2 small ones on the sides and one large
    on the backside),
-   4 sections putting together the components, • 3 racks,
-   12 metal blocks (4 per rack).

### The Odoo ERP Project

As NotSoTiny had a fast growth these past 5 years, it is now in a
situation where all the processes are complex and require a lot of
efforts from the employees: dual encoding, error in processes, several
non-integrated software pieces.

NotSoTiny organized an internal group to manage the ERP project and
selection. After having spent three months to evaluate different ERP
softwares, they decided to go for Odoo ERP, which seems to be far more
advanced than all others competitors.

In order to limit the risk of doing a big integration project at once,
they contacted you to build a functional prototype based on their data.
You will have 5 days to build a clean conﬁguration of Odoo ERP and
organize company processes.

After a ﬁrst meeting with the project managers, you agreed to build the
following prototype in 5 days, incrementally constructing it through
workshops with key company employees:

-   Base System Installation and Conﬁguration
-   Sales Management
-   Purchases Management
-   Accounting and Finance
-   Project Management
-   Human Resources / Employee Directory
-   Warehouse Management
-   MRP / Manufacturing management
-   Document Management System

### Database Setup

Setup a working Odoo ERP database by respecting these steps:

- Open your web client to create a new database:

  - Do not select demonstration data and use English US as default language;
  - Give a name to the database and choose an admin password.

- Install the following generic modules:

  - CRM / Customer Relationship Management
  - Sales Management (Select the generic chart of accounts and set 21% sales and purchase taxes, and click apply)
  - Purchase Management
  - Accounting & Finance
  - MRP / Manufacturing
  - Warehouse Management

- Conﬁgure your company (Settings > Companies):

  - NotSoTiny Company -Union Street, 512 -1000 Brussels Belgium;
  - Currency: Euro;
  - Load your logo if possible.
  - Select the extended interface by accessing the Preferences menu;

### User Setup

NotSoTiny also provides us with the list of users:

  ---------------------------------------------------------------------
  Name, Login & Password   Groups
