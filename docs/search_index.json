Our community is also implicated in the product life and has been developing 3000 extra applications tailored to specific needs. See all our apps at http://www.odoo.com/apps. Online vs On-premise 1.1.2 Online vs On-premise Odoo can be used online or deployed on your own server. For your first steps with Odoo, we recommend you to use the Online version first: Start in a few clicks; Benefit from all the certified Odoo applications; Fully configured: email integration, pads, dns, etc.; Backups, monitoring, redundancy, instance management. Getting Started with Odoo 1.2 Getting Started with Odoo 1.2.1 Create an Odoo Online Instance Go to http://www.odoo.com and clickCRM. Then, enter the name of your instance (with “-” if needed but without spaces or “_”) and click Start Now. Next, enter the required data to create your Odoo account (necessary to create the admin user) and click Start Using. You now have your own instance which will be available at the following web address: yourname.odoo.com. CRM has already been installed. Let’s get some settings straight first! Set up your Company 1.2.2 Set up your Company Click the Odoo logo at the top left corner in order to set your company’s information &amp; logo. Create a New User 1.2.3 Create a New User Go to Settings → Users → Users and create a new user for your colleague. Do not use the same email address. Each user should have his own email address to log on. Note Email: the email address you set, is the one the user has to enter when he logs on to Odoo. As soon as you save the page, Odoo sends a message to that email address so this new user can sign up to Odoo.com and get access to your instance. The new user can choose his own password. Access Rights: The user form allows you to assign specific access rights for each installed application. When you install a new app, have a look at the access rights you can grant to users. Portal: dedicated to external users (i.e. customers to retrieve their orders, invoices in the customer portal). Technical Features: reserved for the instance admin/configurator (access to technical menu). Messaging Alias: on the Preferences tab, you find the internal email address used by Odoo Messaging. If you send an email to that address from an external mailbox, you will receive the message in your Odoo Inbox. Read more about messages in the chapter concerned. Receive Messages by Email: For all the messages received in your Odoo Inbox, a notification can be sent to your external email address (the one used to log on to your Odoo.com account). Here you can change your notification rule. 1.2.4 Install a Second System Language Each user can use Odoo in his own language. Go to Settings → Translations → Load a Translation and install a second language. You can set a default language for each user in the User form. You can also change it in your Preferences (top right side of the screen). 1.3 Populate your Address Book 1.3.1 Enter your First Contact Create your first contact in Form view. Note Blue Field: mandatory field Lookup fields: From Form view, Odoo allows you to open a new list/form in order to select or create another record. There are 3 different types: many-to-one (e.g. countries), one-to-many (e.g. contact persons for a company), many-to-many (e.g. contact tags). Tooltips: hovering the mouse over the field name will display a short help text. Tab key: If the value (content) of a field can be selected from a list of records (e.g. countries), you can quickly select the one required by entering part of its name in the field and hit the Tab key. Create and Edit: If the value of a field can be selected from a list of records, you can quickly create a new one by clicking the drop-down list arrow and selecting Create and Edit. A new form view will open. Search More: If the value of a field can be selected from a list of records and if the desired record does not appear directly in the drop-down list, you can open the complete list of records by clicking ‘Search More’. Back &amp; Forward buttons: In form view, use the back/forward arrows to display the form view of the previous/next record. More button: allows to open related records, delete and duplicate the current record. Print button: shows reports associated with the selected record (when available). 1.3.2 Import your Address Book If you already have a list of contacts, you would waste time if you start entering each item one by one. Let’s import your contact list! From the List view, click Import in order to import your address book saved in CSV (Comma Separated Values, can be generated from Excel, Libre Office Calc, Google Spreadsheet, ...). Have a look at the CSV file shared in your training material repository. You have to follow the same structure. It will help you to make your first import. Once imported, sort the contacts by inverse alphabetical order. Note In your spread sheet file, each column has to be dedicated to a specific Odoo field. The first row contains these dedicated fields. Tip Odoo comes with different kinds of views: List view will show an overview of similar records at a time. To get more specific information about a record, you can switch to Form view. If you want to go further with the import, have a look at the Frequently Asked Questions in the Import interface. For complex imports, send your request to online@odoo.com! We import any kind of data for you: https://www.odoo.com/page/pricing. 1.3.3 Discover the Power of Filters Note Search options: At the top right of all views (except for the Formview) you find a search box with several tools (click the drop-down menu) to configure the search or group the records. The options displayed depend on the business application. Search box: displays all applied filters and allows to quickly find records by typing and selecting some criteria. Matching results will be displayed. Filters: allow you to apply conditions to fields. Some filters exist by default, but you can add new ones (use Save current filter). Group by: groups records in the list according to your needs (multiple levels). Save current filter / Advanced Search: allow to save the current filter (becomes available in Favorites), to edit an advanced search based on conditions, and to add the current filter to a dashboard (see Reporting). In the imported address book: How many physical contacts do you have? Display the contacts (‘persons’ in the filter) and group them by country, then by company. Save the current filter in order to retrieve it next time. Make an advanced search to get all customers located in New York itself. 1.4 Improve your Internal &amp; External Communication 1.4.1 Add Followers and Engage Discussions with them A chatter is available below the form view of various business items. This feature allows you to considerably improve the internal and external communication: any user or external people can be added as followers. Status updates are included as automatic messages. Followers receive email notifications in case of a new message in their inbox. Open the form of one of your contacts. Add your colleague as a follower and send him a message from the chatter (e.g. “I would like to present him to you; he is managing a similar company and could help you in developing the market.”). If you log on as this colleague, you will find the message in your external mailbox. Click the Access your messages and documents in Odoo link to open the contact form and display the context and the message history. Tip This chatter can be used in all Odoo business documents. You can add any contact of your database as a follower (user, customer, supplier, etc.). External people (without user account) will receive your messages in their external mailbox too. Each contact can set up his own notification preferences for each business document he is following. 1.4.2 Easily Create a ToDo List from your Inbox Some messages may require some actions on your side. Click the Star to gather those actions in your ToDo list. Once you have read all your messages in the morning, look at your Todo menu item. You get a list of all the tasks you have to perform. Reply to people or click “V” to mark the message as done. 1.4.3 Start a Discussion Group Users can exchange messages, attach documents and receive discussion updates concerning the groups they joined.

The best way to learn Odoo ERP is to practice a real situation. This chapter presents a learning exercise, based on a simple example, to gradually make you discover the basic functions of Odoo ERP. The goal of this tutorial/exercise is a uniﬁed presentation of the main features of the software, without considering the various details and parameters. 1.7.2 History and market position NotSoTiny is a company located in Belgium, with a dedicated factory manufacturing wooden bookshelves. The company was created in 1978 by Nick Hawson and Luke Stason. Nick Hawson, the current managing director, has a technical background, and is behind the most famous innovations of the company. Luke Stason, the vice-president, has a more commercial and ﬁnancial background. NotSoTiny employs 80 persons, and occupies a leading position in the industry. A strategic market positioning has permitted a clear distinction from NotSoTiny’s competition: A relatively small range of products, but with a high quality, focused mainly on two models of cabinets. An engineering and design ofﬁce that proposes analysis projects tailored for individual and enterprise customers. 1.7.3 Company organisation The various departments of NotSoTiny company are: A Commercial department composed of 1 sales manager and 3 salesmen. It works with 2 types of cus-tomers: direct consumers and retailers. A Research and Development (R&amp;D) department with 1 project manager and 3 prototype developers. They have two main responsibilities: – develop products on the request of large customers, – develop new products. A Production department responsible for manufacturing cupboards as well as efﬁcient maintenance of Bills of Material (BoM) and manufacturing routes. An IT department which will be responsible for the administration of Odoo ERP once it will have been integrated. An Accounting and Financial department which is in charge of the Financial Management. It must also control the budgets of R&amp;D projects and the invoicing processes of the various activities of the company. 1.7.4 NotSoTiny Products The main product of the company is a Picaso bookshelf declined in two different models: a bookshelf having a width of 1 meter, a bookshelf having a width of 2 meters. A “Picaso” bookshelf is composed of 3 external support panels (2 small ones on the sides and one large on the backside), 4 sections putting together the components, • 3 racks, 12 metal blocks (4 per rack). 1.7.5 The Odoo ERP Project As NotSoTiny had a fast growth these past 5 years, it is now in a situation where all the processes are complex and require a lot of efforts from the employees: dual encoding, error in processes, several non-integrated software pieces. NotSoTiny organized an internal group to manage the ERP project and selection. After having spent three months to evaluate different ERP softwares, they decided to go for Odoo ERP, which seems to be far more advanced than all others competitors. In order to limit the risk of doing a big integration project at once, they contacted you to build a functional prototype based on their data. You will have 5 days to build a clean conﬁguration of Odoo ERP and organize company processes. After a ﬁrst meeting with the project managers, you agreed to build the following prototype in 5 days, incrementally constructing it through workshops with key company employees: Base System Installation and Conﬁguration Sales Management Purchases Management Accounting and Finance Project Management Human Resources / Employee Directory Warehouse Management MRP / Manufacturing management Document Management System 1.7.6 Database Setup Setup a working Odoo ERP database by respecting these steps: # Open your web client to create a new database: – Do not select demonstration data and use English US as default language; – Give a name to the database and choose an admin password. # Install the following generic modules: – CRM / Customer Relationship Management, – Sales Management (Select the generic chart of accounts and set 21% sales and purchase taxes, and click apply) – Purchase Management, – Accounting &amp; Finance, – MRP / Manufacturing, – Warehouse Management. # Conﬁgure your company (Settings -&gt; Companies): – NotSoTiny Company -Union Street, 512 -1000 Brussels Belgium; – Currency: Euro; – Load your logo if possible. – Select the extended interface by accessing the Preferences menu; 1.7.7 User Setup NotSoTiny also provides us with the list of users: Name, Login &amp; Password Groups Nick Hawson nick, nick Sales/Manager, Warehouse/Manager, Manufacturing/Manager, Accounting/Manager, Purchase/Manager, Human Resources/Employee, Usability/Technical Features, Technical Setting/Analytic Accounting, Other/Contact Creation Luke Stason luke, luke Sales/Manager, Human Resources/Employee, Usability/Technical Features, Other/Contact Creation Rick Jones rick, rick Sales/All leads, Manufacturing/User, Human Resources/Employee, Usability/Technical Features, Other/Contact Creation Thomas Brown thomas, thomas Sales/All sources/Employee, Usability/Technical Features, Other/Contact Creation 1.7.8 Exercise 21: Create users and their access rights In the Settings menu, deﬁne the different users according to the above table. Nick wants to deﬁne strict rules on how to keep and maintain the customer database. No-one should be able to delete a partner in the database except him. 1.7.9 Exercise 22: Modify security rules Create a new group “Partner deletion” that gives the right to delete a partner. Assign this newly created group to Nick.
